The ADACS astrocomp hack week aims to foster a great learning experience through collaboration and networking of its participants, leveraging their varying skill sets.
We value the participation of every member of the workshop and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout the workshop and to abide by the following Code of Conduct. Any issues can be brought to the confidential attention of the hack week organisers (including via e-mail to rebecca.lange@curtin.edu.au), and thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.
The community of participants of the ADACS astrocomp hack week is made up of members of the Australian astronomy community with a diverse set of skills, personalities, backgrounds, and experiences. It is through these differences that our community experiences success and continued growth. We expect everyone in our community to follow these guidelines when interacting with others both inside and outside of our community. Our goal is to keep ours a positive, inclusive, successful, and growing community.
As members of the community,
We pledge to treat all people with respect and provide a harassment- and bullying-free environment, regardless of sex, sexual orientation and/or gender identity, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, nationality, ethnicity, and religion. In particular, sexual language and imagery, sexist, racist, or otherwise exclusionary jokes are not appropriate.
We pledge to respect the work of others by recognizing acknowledgment/citation requests of original authors. As authors, we pledge to be explicit about how we want our own work to be cited or acknowledged.
We pledge to welcome those interested in joining the community, and realize that including people with a variety of opinions and backgrounds will only serve to enrich our community. In particular, discussions relating to pros/cons of various technologies, programming languages, and so on are welcome, but these should be done with respect, taking proactive measures to ensure that all participants are heard and feel confident that they can freely express their opinions.
We pledge to welcome questions and answer them respectfully, paying particular attention to those new to the community.
We pledge to be conscientious of the perceptions of the wider community and to respond to criticism respectfully. We will strive to model behaviors that encourage productive debate and disagreement, both within our community and where we are criticized. We will treat those outside our community with the same respect as people within our community.
We pledge to help the entire community follow the code of conduct, and to not remain silent when we see violations of the code of conduct. We will take action when members of our community violate this code such as notifying a workshop organizer, emailing rebecca.lange@curtin.edu.au, or talking privately with the person.
This code of conduct applies to all community situations online and offline, including the hack week itself, mailing lists, forums, social media, social events associated with the hack week, and one-to-one interactions.
Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the event at the sole discretion of the conference organizers.
This code of conduct has been adapted from the Python in Astronomy Code of Conduct.
